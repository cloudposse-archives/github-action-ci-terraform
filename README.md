GitHub Action Terraform CI is a collection of GitHub Actions which are meant to cover all CI functionality necessary for
Terraform projects. It also includes a chatops comment handler to allow for on-demand execution of these various tests and commands.

## Usage



Copy the `.github/workflows/terraform-ci.yml` file from this repository into the `.github/workflows` folder of the repository to which you'd like to add Terraform CI functionality.
This will cause CI functionality to execute on pull requests and whenever requested via chatops.
### Chatops
To request functionality via chatops, type `/run [command_name]` or `/test [test_name]` in a comment for any open pull request.
It is possible to request multiple commands or tests in one chatops comment, e.g., `/run command_1 command_2 command_3`.
#### COMMANDS
Some of Cloud Posse's Terraform CI functionality will modify repo files and push a commit with the modified files to the current branch. These commands can be invoked by commenting on a pull request with `/run [command_name]`.

The following is a complete list of all valid run commands:
  * **rebuild-readme**
  * **terraform-fmt**
  * **all** (runs all of the above)
#### TESTS
Some of Cloud Posse's Terraform CI functionality will test the current state of files in the repo, but will not modify them. The results of tests will be listed along with the other status checks at the bottom of a pull request. These tests can be invoked by commenting on a pull request with `/test [test_name]`.

The following is a complete list of all valid tests:
  * **ping**
  * **bats**
  * **readme**
  * **terratest**
  * **all** (runs all of the above)

## Quick Start

Here's how to get started...
1. Copy the `.github/workflows/terraform-ci.yml` file from this repository into the `.github/workflows` folder of the target repo
2. Open a pull request inthe target repo
3. Optional - use chatops commands in comments on the pull request (e.g., `/test all`) as detailed in the [usage section](#usage)


## Examples

Here's a real world example:
- [`github-action-terraform-ci`](https://github.com/cloudposse/github-action-terraform-ci/.github/workflows/terraform-ci.yml) - Cloud Posse's self-testing Terraform CI GitHub Action repo



## Sub-action: github-action-terraform-ci-bulk-status-update

### Description

This action handles the dispatching of status-update commands. It is called by the top-level `cloudposse/github-action-terraform-ci` command and can call the `terraform-ci-status` sub-action with a variety of inputs.

## Sub-action: github-action-terraform-ci-rebuild-readme

### Description

This action rebuilds the `README.md` of the target repo. It is called by the `terraform-ci-handle-commands` sub-action, which is itself called by the top-level `cloudposse/github-action-terraform-ci` action, and it calls the `cloudposse/github-action-atuo-format` action with an input of `script-names: readme`.

## Sub-action: github-action-terraform-ci-terraform-fmt

### Description

This action ensures that all Terraform files in the target repo are properly formatted. It is called by the `terraform-ci-handle-commands` sub-action, which is itself called by the top-level `cloudposse/github-action-terraform-ci` action, and it calls the `cloudposse/github-action-auto-format` action with an input value of `script-names: terraform_format`.

## Sub-action: github-action-terraform-ci-comment-response

### Description

This action modifies comments left on open pull requests inthe target repo, indicating which tests and commands will be executed as a result. It is called by the top-level `cloudposse/github-action-terraform-ci` action.

## Sub-action: github-action-terraform-ci-handle-commands

### Description

This action calls any commands (not tests) that have been triggered. It is called by the top-level `cloudposse/github-action-terraform-ci` action and calls the `terraform-ci-rebuild-readme` and `terraform-ci-terraform-fmt` sub-actions.

## Sub-action: github-action-terraform-ci-handle-tests

### Description

This action calls any tests (not commands) that have been triggered. It is called by the top-level `cloudposse/github-action-terraform-ci` action and calls the `terraform-ci-bats`, `terraform-ci-ping`, `terraform-ci-readme`, and `terraform-ci-terratest` sub-actions.

## Sub-action: github-action-terraform-ci-metadata

### Description

This action extracts data from the triggering event, whether `pull_request` or `chatops`, which allows the top-level `cloudposse/terraform-ci` action to determine which commands and tests to execute. It is called by the top-level `cloudposse/github-action-terraform-ci` action.

## Sub-action: github-action-terraform-ci-status

### Description

This action changes the status of a test check on a given commit. It is called by the top-level `cloudposse/github-action-terraform-ci` action and all of the test sub-actions (`terraform-ci-bats`, `terraform-ci-ping`, `terraform-ci-readme`, `terraform-ci-terratest`).

## Sub-action: github-action-terraform-ci-bats

### Description

This action runs `bats` tests against the files in the target repo. It is called by the `terraform-ci-handle-tests` sub-action, which itself is called by the top-level `cloudposse/github-action-terraform-ci` action.

## Sub-action: github-action-terraform-ci-ping

### Description

This action runs a positive control test against the target repo, just to prove that the CI infrastructure is functioning properly. No files are changed, only the status of the test on the current commit. It is called by the `terraform-ci-handle-tests` sub-action, which itself is called by the top-level `cloudposse/github-action-terraform-ci` action.

## Sub-action: github-action-terraform-ci-readme

### Description

This action tests the `README.md` file in the target repo was built from the `README.yaml` file using the Cloud Posse standard `make readme` function. It is called by the `terraform-ci-handle-tests` sub-action, which itself is called by the top-level `cloudposse/github-action-terraform-ci` action.

## Sub-action: github-action-terraform-ci-terratest

### Description

This action sets up the environment, including the environment variables, needed to run the `terratest` functionality on the target repo. It is called by the `terraform-ci-handle-tests` sub-action, which itself is called by the top-level `cloudposse/github-action-terraform-ci` action, and it calls the `terraform-ci-determine-terraform-version` and `terraform-ci-execute-terratest` sub-actions.

## Sub-action: github-action-terraform-ci-determine-terraform-version

### Description

This action is a utility actions for the `cloudposse/test-harness@latest` Docker image. It determines the version of Terraform installed on the image. It is called by the `terraform-ci-terratest` and `terraform-ci-terraform-fmt` sub-actions.

## Sub-action: github-action-terraform-ci-execute-terratest

### Description

This action executes the `terratest` functionality on the target repo. It is called by the `terraform-ci-terratest` sub-action, which is called by the `terraform-ci-handle-tests` sub-action, which in turn is called by the top-level `cloudposse/github-action-terraform-ci` action.
